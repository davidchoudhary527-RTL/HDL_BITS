# HDLBits Problem Set – Verilog Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) problem set, implemented in **Verilog HDL**.  
The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey, practice digital design concepts, and share resources with others exploring Verilog and FPGA design.

## About HDLBits
HDLBits is an online platform that provides a collection of digital design exercises ranging from basic logic circuits to advanced modules such as finite state machines and sequential logic.  
It is a great way to practice **HDL coding skills** and strengthen your understanding of digital design.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized according to problem categories from HDLBits:

├── Basics/ # Simple gates, multiplexers, adders
├── Combinational/ # ALU, encoders, decoders, comparators
├── Sequential/ # Flip-flops, latches, counters, shift registers
├── FSM/ # Finite State Machines
├── Memories/ # RAM, ROM, etc.
└── Testbenches/ # Testbenches for verification

 Future Work

1. Add detailed README files for each folder with explanations of problems.
2. Upload my personal Verilog projects alongside HDLBits solutions.
3. Include waveform screenshots for visual verification of key modules.

 Why This Repo?

1. To document and track my progress in HDL learning.
2. To provide a reference for others practicing HDLBits.
3. To serve as a foundation for future FPGA/ASIC projects.
